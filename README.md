# üìù A Blog on Computational Mathematics

Welcome! Thanks for your interest in contributing your thoughts on computational mathematics, research methods, and software. Our blog uses [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org), a publishing system that integrates markdown with severl computing tools. It's like a research notebook that allows for dynamic content creation, making it a perfect fit for a wide range of topics, including tutorials, research findings, and technical insights.

## ‚ùì What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It enables authors to create dynamic documents, reports, presentations, and dashboards. Quarto documents are authored using Markdown, an easy-to-write plain text format, which then can be converted into a wide array of output formats including HTML, PDF, and Word, among others.

For more information on Quarto and how to get started with it, please refer to the official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/).

## Authoring `.qmd` Files

A `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) file is where you'll write your blog post. It allows for embedding code, output of code (like graphs), and narrative text. Here's a quick guide to authoring a `.qmd` file:

- **Basic Syntax**: Quarto uses an extended version of the Markdown syntax, allowing for more advanced features like citations, cross-references, and figure formatting. See the [Quarto Markdown Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for a comprehensive overview.
- **Executable Code**: Quarto can execute code within `.qmd` files for various programming languages (including R, Python, and Julia) and include their outputs directly in the document. Learn more about [executable code in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/).
- **YAML Front Matter**: Each `.qmd` file should start with a YAML front matter block, where metadata like the title, author, and date are specified. This is crucial for blog posts to be processed correctly.

## Contributing Your Blog Post

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Git and GitHub.
- A GitHub account.
- Basic knowledge of Quarto and Markdown syntax.

### Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**

3. **Create a New Branch**
    - Create a branch for your post with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.

### Writing Your Blog Post

1. **Create Your Post Directory**
    - Inside `posts`, create a subdirectory for your post, e.g., `mkdir posts/my-new-post`.

2. **Add Your Content**
    - Create an `index.qmd` file. Write your post here, including the YAML front matter at the top.

3. **Commit and Push**
    - Stage changes with `git add .` and commit them with `git commit -m "Your message"`.
    - Push to your fork with `git push origin <branch-name>`.
