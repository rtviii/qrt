title: "Creating a post"
---

```bash
mkdir -p posts/my-new-post # make it unique!
cd posts/my-new-post
```
Now create a file called `index.qmd` with the following minimal yaml frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My new post"
date: "2024-01-31"
author: "Your Name"
---
```

If you'll be embedding code in your post, at minimum you need to make sure that you have Jupyter installed.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
pip3 install jupyter jupyter-cache
```

## Generate a pull request

For now, I'm asking folks to push their pages by generaing a [pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdSwWxVzUpo). Once we have a better sense of how the system works, it may be easier to just push your changes directly.
